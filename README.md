# Crypto_AlgoTrading
 HKU FYP Project 2022

In this project, we would first perform comprehensive exploration for existing methods or strategies which have already shown success in traditional stock or forex market. Different trading strategies, including momentum trading, statistical arbitrage, or the use of deep-learning-based reinforcement learning trading agent would be explored. We would also explore the possible data enrichment such as applying sentiment analysis on cryptocurrency market-related text data.

To evaluate how these methods perform in the cryptocurrency market, we would apply back-testing and compare the results to each other. Besides, buy and hold Bitcoin is selected as our benchmark to assess how the methods are performing when compared to the market. Further optimizations and results analysis would be conducted on individual methods for the better ground to propose more sophisticated combination of methods.
